<h2> Summary of Peps Adventure</h2>
<p>Ancient powerful crystals are holding up a set of floating islands with their immense energy. 
You, as our protagonist, Pep, have heard little knowledge of this -- that is, until the mysterious villain, Jesse-Clay, arrives on the island you call home and destroys the crystal keeping it afloat, shattering it into shard pieces and scattering the remains around the surrounding islands causing Pep’s home to fall from the sky.
Pep is a young SATYR who has a playful sense of humour, and a dry outlook on the life he’s led thus far. 
As Pep you will travel the world of the floating islands to collect the shard pieces and restore the life force to the islands, before they all fall out of the sky for good.<p/>
